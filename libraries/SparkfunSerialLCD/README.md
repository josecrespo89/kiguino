## SparkfunSerialLCD

Set of simple routines for interfacing with 16x2 LCD serial screen
by Sparkfun.  I tried using this with another serial LCD screen, and
it was not compatible, so I am guessing each LCD interprets characters
in their own way.

I use one of these LCDs as a debugging tool: every module could have a
serial out using only one pin, and provide useful debugging information.

Most of the time permanently attached LCD screen is a complete overkill, 
so this approach provides happy medium.
