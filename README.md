## Kiguino â€“ Arduino Libs, Sketches and Useful Things

I've organized things as much as possible for complete clarity.  

  * sketches is where my sample, experimental, live/production, etc sketches live.
  * libraries is where my shareable libraries, that do lots of useful things are located. Most libs contain their own README.md, but if not read the comments of the .cpp or .h file for details.
