These two folders contain two separate projects: 

* TrinketSetTime is used to set the clock's current time to the compile time of the sketch.
* TrinketClock is used to display current time on the large 7-segment display.

While the hardware design originally included TMP36 thermometer, the code to display 
temperature was removed due to it being highly inaccurate.
